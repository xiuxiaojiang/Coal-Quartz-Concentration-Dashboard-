            <p>
                <strong>Monitoring Coal Quartz Concentration for Silica Rule Compliance</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                This dashboard visualizes and analyzes coal quartz concentration levels, using public data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), to support stakeholders in monitoring and managing exposure to coal dust. The data is essential for compliance with new silica regulations and for efforts to reduce the risk of black lung disease in the mining industry. The concentration levels are categorized into three ranges: greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter, between 25 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter, and less than 25 micrograms per cubic meter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dashboard includes five key visualizations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concentration Summary Table:</strong> Displays the number of samples in each concentration category—greater than 50 , between 25 and 50, and less than 25 micrograms per cubic meter — along with the total number of samples analyzed, providing an overview of exposure levels across all samples.</li>
                <li><strong>Quartz Concentration by Year (Bar Chart):</strong> Shows the distribution of coal quartz concentration levels by year, helping to track trends and assess whether efforts to reduce exposure are having a positive impact over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Yearly Percent Change in High-Concentration Samples (Line Chart):</strong> Tracks the percent change in the number of samples with concentrations greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter, offering insights into trends in high-risk exposures year over year.</li>
                <li><strong>Top 15 Occupations with High Exposure (Bar Chart):</strong> Highlights the top 15 occupations with the most samples exceeding 50 micrograms per cubic meter of coal quartz concentration, helping to identify workers at higher risk and informing targeted safety measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Concentration Distribution by Sample Type (Bar Chart):</strong> Breaks down the samples with concentrations greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter by sample type, providing a clearer picture of where high exposure is most prevalent across different types of workplace samples.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These visualizations empower stakeholders to monitor exposure levels, assess trends, and ensure compliance with silica regulations, all while guiding efforts to reduce coal quartz concentrations and minimize the risk of black lung disease in the workforce.
